# New for Me — iNaturalist Lifer Mapper

Find species you haven't observed yet in any area, mapped with real observation locations.

## How to Use

1. **Enter your iNaturalist username** — this is how the app looks up your life list.

2. **Pick an area** using one of two methods:

   - **Radius mode** — Tap anywhere on the map to drop a pin, or hit "Use my location" for GPS. Adjust the radius (1–100 km). When you set a location, nearby iNaturalist places (parks, reserves, counties) appear as tappable chips — tap one to search within that exact boundary instead of a rough circle.
   
   - **Place mode** — Search for any iNaturalist place by name (e.g. "Quabbin Reservoir", "Hampshire County", "Mt Tom State Reservation").

3. **Filter by taxon** (optional) — Narrow results to a group like Birds, Odonata, Fungi, etc. Leave blank to compare your entire life list.

4. **Set a time window** — Choose how recent the area's observations should be: last 2 weeks, last month, last 3 months, last year, or any time. Your life list is always compared in full regardless of this filter.

5. **Tap "Find what's new for me"** and wait for results.

## Reading the Results

- The **results bar** at the bottom shows how many species in the area are new for you, along with area totals and your list size.
- Tap the bar to **expand the species list**, sorted by observation count (most-observed first).
- Each species card links to its **iNaturalist taxon page**. The 📍 button zooms the map to that species' observations.
- **Colored dots on the map** are individual observations, clustered at wider zoom levels. Dot color indicates taxonomic group (red = birds, green = plants, gold = insects, etc.).
- **Tap any dot** to see the observation photo, species name, date, observer, and a link to view it on iNaturalist.

## Tips

- **Start with a taxon filter** for faster results. Searching all of life for a large area can be slow on the first run.
- **Nearby place chips** are the best way to search — iNaturalist's place boundaries are much more accurate than a radius circle for parks and reserves.
- The app maps observations for the top 200 new-for-me species. If you need more, narrow your taxon or area.
- Results work best with "Last year" or shorter time windows. "Any time" in a large area can pull enormous datasets.
